//In this component only the accordian card title and length of items eg recomended(4) is only built here

//The description part like menu list and price name is built in ItemList component(child component) and also click handle

//This is the child component of RestaurantMenu (parent component ) and parent component can control its child component
//This is known as controlled component i.e the child component is now a controlled component
//Previously when it had its own state it was an uncontrolled component (episode 11)
//The child component can modify the state variable of parent; its possible indirectly by
// Passing the setShowIndex to this component from parent component
//

  //refer Restaurant Menu when u want to just open one accordian at a time.
  //The below code works for controlled component
  // const handleClick = () => {
  //   setShowIndex();
  // };
